# Procrastination Buster

## Overview
Procrastination Buster is a simple decision-support web app designed to help users overcome **decision paralysis**, which is one of the most common causes of procrastination.

Instead of asking users to plan extensively or reflect deeply, the app provides an **instant action suggestion**, allowing users to start working immediately without overthinking.

The core idea is to reduce mental friction and help users move from *thinking* to *doing*.

## Problem Statement
Many people procrastinate not because they are lazy, but because they:
- Feel overwhelmed by multiple tasks
- Don’t know where to start
- Overthink the “perfect” choice
- Keep delaying action due to indecision

Traditional productivity tools often fail because they:
- Require long setup
- Expect discipline and consistency
- Add more planning instead of action

---

## Solution
Procrastination Buster solves this by acting as a **decision trigger**.

The user:
1. Enters a list of tasks they need or want to do
2. Clicks a single button
3. The app instantly selects one task for them

This removes the burden of choice and encourages immediate action.

---

## How It Works
1. User inputs tasks (any number)
2. The app randomly selects one task
3. The selected task is displayed as the **action to start now**

The randomness is intentional:
- It eliminates overthinking
- It reduces emotional resistance
- It makes starting easier
